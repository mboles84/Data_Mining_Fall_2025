    "##### I don't know why but this week took me a minute to get it together. Gensim wasn't working for me no matter how much I was looking online and different fixes, so I had to pivot to spaCY instead to do the text summarization. The movie I chose was Howl's Moving Castle by Hiyao Miyazaki and I chose the English dubbed manuscript to summarize. It's kind of funny seeing it now and it's a lot of Sophie/Howl in the summary for the topp 200 words that I wanted to see what was the most common.\n",

    "##### For this assignment I did some preprocessing by removing numbers using regex, then using spaCy's to lemmatize, removing stop words, and excluding punctuation and normalizing whitespace. Then for the summarization we tokenize the text into spaCy and score the sentences based on frequency of preprocessed words using 'Counter' then we selected the top 20% of sentences limited to 200 words and joining the sentences into a summary. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### I think I would've liked an abstract summarization instead of going the route of the top words of the sentences. I'm not sure. It works, but it's not very meaningful, but a lot of my issues with the assignment comes from the frustrations with gensim not working the way I wanted, so I wanted to wrap this up and move on. "
