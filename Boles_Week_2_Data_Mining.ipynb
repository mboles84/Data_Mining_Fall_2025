    "###### This week we used the boredAPI to request a response from the API, and then with the response create an output from the API to give information from our get request. I decided this week to appropriately use the json/request library so that we could access the API. In my first section I wanted to see the API results simply posted out to reference them for the start of the project, however I missed the price the initial time, and looking at the boredAPI website I realized I was missing that information from the request. I then went into the next part of my code to display the different outputs of the JSON request in a bit of a more interesting output than just the dictionary output we got in the first section. \n",
    "\n",
    "###### In my final section, I saved a specific key that we got earlier to use that key to get the same information on repeat. I also simplified the output for the last run, so that I could have the JSON data displayed easily. With this, I should satisfy all of the requirements of the assignment for this week! \n",
    "\n",
    "###### Working with API's is pretty fun, and there are some goofy ones out there, I liked this one though, and I enjoyed the results from it! I'll have to refer my daughter to this one if she is ever bored and make her do whatever it says! "
